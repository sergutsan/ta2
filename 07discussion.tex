The results from both the Formative and the Summative evaluations of
the TA tools are encouraging. From the analysis in Section 5 of the results 
of the formative evaluation session held with a cohort of trainee Maths teachers,
we see that participants understood the capabilities of
the tools and were able to use them effectively in answering most
of the usage-scenario based questions. 
The number of responses fell in relation to usage scenarios US4 and US7, 
that concern identifying common conceptual and procedural difficulties
students are facing, 
providing more explanation to the class as a whole, and 
providing guidance to individual students during and after the lesson.
This finding is corroborated by the 
classroom trial held with a teacher at her school, discussed in Section 6,
who reported that answering such questions
required having a global view of the class's `learning status' 
that was difficult to obtain from the tools.
None-the-less, we were pleased to see that a small number of the 
trainee Maths teachers commented that being able to view the occurrence 
of all the indicators in the ST tool does allow teachers
``to identify the most common misconceptions which could then be
consolidated in the following lesson''. 


From the analysis in Section 6 of the results of the classroom trial held with a
teacher in her school as part of the Summative evaluation,
we observed that the teacher was able to use the full suite of TA
tools to address usage scenarios US1, US2, US3, US5, US6, US8 as she undertook a
lesson using MiGen. As noted above, she had difficulty with US4 and US7.
None-the-less, she reported being ``extremely pleased'' with the TA tools. 
One of the main reasons for this seemed to be the experience of control over the class
that she was able to gain using them. With a quick glance at the information being
displayed by the TA tools, this teacher was able to know which students
were making good progress, which students were waiting for her help,
and which students were falling behind with respect to the task goals.
After the subsequent lesson, undertaken without using the TA tools,
she reported that it was not possible to obtain a view
of the class' progress for so many (28) students, 
and that having access to the TA tools during the first lesson 
had made a real difference. 

From the analysis in Section 6 of the second part of the Summative
evaluation, held with another cohort of trainee Maths teachers, 
we see that participants were able to use the tools to provide
correct answers to questions relating to US1--US6 and that no
answers were perceived as requiring ``a long time'' or ``a lot of time''.
In the analysis of the answers to the end-of-session questionnaire,
relating to participants' perceived usefulness of the TA tools, 
only Q7 (relating to usage scenario US4) had any answers of Disagree 
(2 such answers, out of 11 participants); Q7 also had 4 answers of Not Sure.
Q4 (relating to US2 and US7(i)) also attracted 4 answers of Not Sure. 


All of these results point to the usefulness of the TA tools for the
identified usage scenarios. 
None-the-less, the limited number of classroom trials that
it has been possible to undertake given the timescale and resources of
the project, and the difficulties that some evaluation participants
faced in using the tools for the more complex usage scenarios of
identifying common difficulties that students were facing and
formulating their guidance to students, point to the need for
further research, both in attempting to further elicit teachers' needs
from such tools and in undertaking more classroom-based trials.


% We have found that undertaking research in the use of exploratory
% learning environments (ELE) in schools and, specifically, research in
% tools for assisting the teacher is extremely challenging in the
% UK. There are two main reasons for this. First, ELE are not a normal
% part of classroom teaching most schools we have collaborated with. It
% is our impression that the reason for this relates to the need for
% significant support from the teacher in order for ELE to be effective
% in the learning process. As tools such as MiGen that provide
% intelligent support to students as they are undertaking exploratory
% tasks become more common, this situation may change, and teachers may
% be more willing to include use of ELE in their lessons. A second
% challenge we faced was that the use of Teacher Assistance tools such
% as those that MiGen provides is quite new to teachers, and requires a
% change from their usual routine of walking around the classroom to see
% how students are progressing and to provide help on the basis of their
% observations. On the positive side, we have seen evidence in our
% formative and summative evaluations with current and future maths
% teachers that tools such as the ones we have presented here may be
% playing a role in reversing this situation.
% 
% We believe that one of the main factors in the resistance to the use
% of ELE in the classroom is the teacherâ€™s sensation of lack of control
% of the situation: traditional learning is structured in nature, with
% the teacher being in control of the pace and direction of the
% students' learning; in contrast, exploratory environments challenge
% these assumptions. Therefore, tools that can empower teachers by
% making them aware of the `state' of their classroom may serve as a
% bridge that facilitates increased use of ELE in classrooms in the
% future.
