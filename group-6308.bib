However, in schools and universities, students are usually not taught teamwork skills. In this paper, we introduce learning to collaborate by collaborating, a process that enables collaboration and teamwork skills to be taught and measured through face-to-face collaborative work and class-wide activities supported by wirelessly connected hand-held devices. Following a description of learning to collaborate by collaborating, we present an experimental study whose results demonstrate that participants in the process displayed improved teamwork performance. We conclude that it is possible to effectively teach collaboration skills through the use of immediate feedback provided by a supporting technology.}},

The objective of this article is to provide teachers and students with a tool to help them in their effort of orchestrating learning, that makes use of awareness artefacts. Using this powerful mechanism in lab sessions, we propose four different aspects of orchestration as the target for improvement: the management of the resources in the learning environment; the interventions of the teacher and provision of formative feedback; the collection of evidences for summative assessment; and the re-design of the activity, adjusting some parameters for future enactments. The proposal has been tested in a real course of Multimedia Applications with junior students (3rd course), measuring the benefits for the orchestration.}},

considers three parts, each one focusing on the three most important questions related to support at any given

how should the support be presented for maximum efficacy? (presentation). The benefits of this approach
include easier testing and validation, more reliable progress, and better communication and management of

The teacher often creates these, and the way that they are set up, and how they are used for particular learning purposes. If the relationships between grouping size, interaction type and learning tasks in groups are planned strategically then learning experiences will be more effective. However, research suggests that the relationships between these elements are often unplanned and the 'social pedagogic' potential of classroom learning is therefore unrealised. In this paper we explore the notion of social pedagogy in relation to group work. It is argued that research and theory relevant to group work in classrooms is limited, and that a new approach, sensitive to group work under everyday classroom conditions is required. This paper identifies key features of a social pedagogy of classroom group work, which can inform effective group work in classrooms. It also describes the background to a current large scale UK project which has been set up to design with teachers a programme of high quality group work in classrooms at both primary and secondary phases.}},

The discourse of six pairs of students, engaged in interpreting and graphing problem situations involving rational functions, was analyzed by means of recently developed methodological tools. The nature of the mathematics that emerged for each pair was found to be related to several factors that included the characteristics of the interpersonal object-level utterances both before and after the solution path had been generated, the degree of activity of the personal channels of the interlocutors, and the extent to which the thoughts of participants were made explicit in the public discourse. The analysis of the discursive interactions provided evidence that adolescents within novel problem situations can experience some difficulty in making their emergent thinking available to their partners in such a way that the interaction be highly mathematically productive for both of them.}},

Sticky notes on the stencil's surface provide necessary tutorial material in the context of the application. In a user study comparing a Stencils-based and paper-based version of the same tutorial in Alice, a complex software application designed to teach introductory computer programming, we found that users of a Stencils-based tutorial were able complete the tutorial 26\% faster, with fewer errors, and less reliance on human assistance.

Some promising approaches in the recent past have attempted tackling the problem of evaluating adaptivity by  ” decomposing” and evaluating it in a  ” piece-wise” manner. Separating the evaluation of different aspects can help to identify problems in the adaptation process. This paper presents a framework that can be used to guide the  ” layered” evaluation of adaptive systems, and a set of formative methods that have been tailored or specially developed for the evaluation of adaptivity. The proposed framework unifies previous approaches in the literature and has already been used, in various guises, in recent research work. The presented methods are related to the layers in the framework and the stages in the development lifecycle of interactive systems. The paper also discusses practical issues surrounding the employment of the above, and provides a brief overview of complementary and alternative approaches in the literature.}},

    abstract = {{Tangible technologies and shared interfaces create new paradigms for mediating collaboration through dynamic, synchronous environments, where action is as important as speech for participating and contributing to the activity. However, interaction with shared interfaces has been shown to be inherently susceptible to peer interference, potentially hindering productive forms of collaborative learning. Making learners effectively engage in processes of argumentative co-construction of knowledge is challenging in such exploratory learning environments. This paper adapts the social modes dimension of Weinberger and Fischer's (Computers and Education 46(1):71–95, 2006 ) analytical framework (for argumentative co-construction of knowledge) to analyse episodes of interference, in the context of a shared tabletop interface, to better understand its effect on collaborative knowledge construction. Studies involved 43 students, aged 11–14 years, interacting in groups of three, with a tangible tabletop application to learn basic concepts of the behaviour of light. Contrary to the dominant perspective, our analysis suggests that interference in shared interfaces can be productive for learning, serving as a trigger for promoting argumentation and collective knowledge construction. Interference episodes led to both productive and counter-productive learning opportunities. They were resolved through quick consensus building, when students abandoned their own activity and accepted changes made by others; integration-oriented consensus building, where students reflected on and integrated what happened in the investigation; or conflict-oriented consensus building where students tried to undo others' actions and rebuild previous configurations. Overall, interference resolved through integration-oriented consensus building was found to lead to productive learning interactions, while counter-productive situations were mostly characterised by interference resolved through conflict-oriented consensus building.}},

A set of tools that can be used in empirical studies to measure these dimensions of fun is described in detail. These tools include a Smileyometer, a Fun-Sorter and an Again-Again table. Three user trials, in which the tools have been used, are described and suggestions are made for the use of each of the tools with children. A discussion of the efficacy of the tools presents the findings that there is a sufficient subset that can be used to give a reliable measure of fun. Dependent on the nature of the event being evaluated and on the number of activities being compared; the subset will be differently constructed. The paper concludes with observations about the difficulties of measuring fun with children, and some areas for further work are presented. 1.}},

    abstract = {{In recent years there has been increasing interest in the phenomena of "gaming the system," where a learner attempts to succeed in an educational environment by exploiting properties of the system's help and feedback rather than by attempting to learn the material. Developing environments that respond constructively and effectively to gaming depends upon understanding why students choose to game. In this article, we present three studies, conducted with two different learning environments, which present evidence on which student behaviors, motivations, and emotions are associated with the choice to game the system. We also present a fourth study to determine how teachers' perspectives on gaming behavior are similar to, and different from, researchers' perspectives and the data from our studies. We discuss what motivational and attitudinal patterns are associated with gaming behavior across studies, and what the implications are for the design of interactive learning environment.}},

This book is diSessa's informed and passionate affirmative answer to that question.<br /> <br /> While written at a level that anyone with a good acquaintance with high school science can understand, the book reflects the depth and breadth of the issues surrounding technology in education. Rejecting the simplistic notion that the computer is merely a tool for more efficient instruction, diSessa shows how computers can be the basis for a new literacy that will change how people think and learn. He discusses the learning theory that explains why computers can be such powerful catalysts for change in education, in particular, how intuitive knowledge is the platform on which students build scientific understanding. He also discusses the material and social reasons for the computer's potential and argues for "two-way literacies," where everyone is a creator as well as consumer of dynamic and interactive expressive forms. DiSessa gives many examples from his work using the Boxer computer environment, an integrated software system designed to investigate computational literacies.}},

Moreover, multiple solutions which are equally valid are possible and a common and efficient way to convey this is by promoting and supporting students' collaboration. Successful collaboration, however, depends on forming groups in which the activity is relevant for all members of the group. In this paper we present a computational model for group formation for open-ended exploration in ELEs by modelling the various strategies that learners adopt to solve the same task. This is underpinned by Group Technology techniques that use as criteria the learners' strategies and the similarity among them to form groups that match pedagogy considerations.

This paper presents a conceptual model that employs a synergistic approach based on Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Multicriteria Decision Making (MDM) components for learner modelling and feedback generation during exploration in an ill-defined domain of mathematical generalisation. The CBR component is used to diagnose what students are doing on the basis of simple and composite cases; simple cases represent parts of the models that the learners could possibly construct during an exploratory learning activity, while composite cases, which are assembled from simple cases, correspond to strategies that learners may adopt to construct their models. Similarity measures are used to identify how close/far are the learners from solutions pre-specified and stored in the knowledge base. This information is then fed into the MDM component that is responsible for prioritising types of feedback depending on the context. The operation of the two components and the effectiveness of the synergistic approach are validated through user scenarios in the context of an exploratory learning environment for mathematical generalisation.}},

Gibson for the design of common objects and both implicitly and explicitly adjusted the meaning given by Gibson. There was, however, ambiguity in Norman\^{a}s original definition and use of affordances which he has subsequently made efforts to clarify. His definition germinated quickly and through a review of the HCI literature we show that this ambiguity has lead to widely varying uses of the concept. Norman has recently acknowledged the ambiguity, however, important clarifications remain. Using affordances as a basis, we elucidate the role of the designer and the distinction between usefulness and usability. We expand Gibson\^{a}s definition into a framework for design.}},

To the designer or teacher, however, not all these strategies are known in advance and, even if they were, introducing them in the knowledge base would involve considerable time and effort. In previous work, we have proposed a case-based knowledge representation, modelling the learners behaviour when constructing/exploring models through simple cases and sequences of cases, called strategies. In this paper, we enhance this approach with adaptive mechanisms for expanding the knowledge base. These mechanisms allow to identify and store inefficient cases, i.e. cases that pose additional difficulty to students in their learning process, and to gradually enrich the knowledge base by detecting and adding new strategies.}},

The first step towards such ITSs is reaching a wide agreement about the terminology used in the area. In this paper, we discuss the two important dimensions of ill-definedness: the domain and the instructional task. By the domain we assume declarative domain knowledge, or the domain theory, while the instructional task is the task the student is learning, in terms of problem-solving skills. It is possible to have a well-defined domain and still have ill-defined instructional tasks in the same domain. We look deeper at the features of ill-defined tasks, which all contribute to their ill/well defined nature. The paper discusses model-tracing and constraint-based modeling, in terms of their suitability for ill-defined tasks and domains. We show that constraint-based modeling can be used in both well-and illdefined domains, and illustrate our conclusion using several instructional tasks.}},

@article{Roll2007Designing,
    abstract = {{Intelligent Tutoring Systems have been shown to be very effective in supporting learning in domains such as mathematics, physics, computer programming, etc. However, they are yet to achieve similar success in tutoring metacognition. While an increasing number of educational technology systems support productive metacognitive behavior within the scope of the system, few attempt to teach skills students need to become better future learners. To that end, we offer a set of empirically-based design principles for metacognitive tutoring. Our starting point is a set of design principles put forward by Anderson et al. ( Journal of the Learning Sciences , 4:167–207, 1995) regarding Cognitive Tutors, a family of Intelligent Tutoring Systems. We evaluate the relevance of these principles to the tutoring of help-seeking skills, based on our ongoing empirical work with the Help Tutor. This auxiliary tutor agent is designed to help students learn to make effective use of the help facilities offered by a Cognitive Tutor. While most of Anderson's principles are relevant to the tutoring of help seeking, a number of differences emerge as a result of the nature of metacognitive knowledge and of the need to combine metacognitive and domain-level tutoring. We compare our approach to other metacognitive tutoring systems, and, where appropriate, propose new guidelines to promote the discussion regarding the nature and design of metacognitive tutoring within scaffolded problem-solving environments.}},

    abstract = {{The research reported in this paper focuses on the hypothesis that an intelligent tutoring system that provides guidance with respect to students' meta-cognitive abilities can help them to become better learners. Our strategy is to extend a Cognitive Tutor (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, \& Pelletier, 1995) so that it not only helps students acquire domain-specific skills, but also develop better general help-seeking strategies. In developing the Help Tutor, we used the same Cognitive Tutor technology at the meta-cognitive level that has been proven to be very effective at the cognitive level. A key challenge is to develop a model of how students should use a Cognitive Tutor's help facilities. We created a preliminary model, implemented by 57 production rules that capture both effective and ineffective help-seeking behavior. As a first test of the model's efficacy, we used it off-line to evaluate students' help-seeking behavior in an existing data set of student-tutor interactions. We then refined the model based on the results of this analysis. Finally, we conducted a pilot study with the Help Tutor involving four students. During one session, we saw a statistically significant reduction in students' meta-cognitive error rate, as determined by the Help Tutor's model. These preliminary results inspire confidence as we gear up for a larger-scale controlled experiment to evaluate whether tutoring on help seeking has a positive effect on students' learning outcomes.}},

Subsets of the data indicate that even better results are possible. This research provides solid support for the concept of using a knowledge base to recognize content in free-entry text discussion.

    abstract = {{Argumentation is an important skill to learn. It is valuable not only in many professional contexts, such as the law, science, politics, and business, but also in everyday life. However, not many people are good arguers. In response to this, researchers and practitioners over the past 15–20 years have developed software tools both to support and teach argumentation. Some of these tools are used in individual fashion, to present students with the  rules  of argumentation in a particular domain and give them an opportunity to practice, while other tools are used in collaborative fashion, to facilitate communication and argumentation between multiple, and perhaps distant, participants. In this paper, we review the extensive literature on argumentation systems, both individual and collaborative, and both supportive and educational, with an eye toward particular aspects of the past work. More specifically, we review the types of argument representations that have been used, the various types of interaction design and ontologies that have been employed, and the system architecture issues that have been addressed. In addition, we discuss intelligent and automated features that have been imbued in past systems, such as automatically analyzing the quality of arguments and providing intelligent feedback to support and/or tutor argumentation. We also discuss a variety of empirical studies that have been done with argumentation systems, including, among other aspects, studies that have evaluated the effect of argument diagrams (e.g., textual versus graphical), different representations, and adaptive feedback on learning argumentation. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the  lessons learned  from this large and impressive body of work, particularly focusing on lessons for the CSCL research community and its ongoing efforts to develop computer-mediated collaborative argumentation systems.}},

In <i>Group Cognition</i> Gerry Stahl explores the technological and social reconfigurations that are needed to achieve computer-supported collaborative knowledge building--group cognition that transcends the limits of individual cognition. Computers can provide active media for social group cognition where ideas grow through the interactions within groups of people; software functionality can manage group discourse that results in shared understandings, new meanings, and collaborative learning. Stahl offers software design prototypes, analyzes empirical instances of collaboration, and elaborates a theory of collaboration that takes the group, rather than the individual, as the unit of analysis. <br /> <br /> Stahl's design studies concentrate on mechanisms to support group formation, multiple interpretive perspectives, and the negotiation of group knowledge in applications as varied as collaborative curriculum development by teachers, writing summaries by students, and designing space voyages by NASA engineers. His empirical analysis shows how, in small-group collaborations, the group constructs intersubjective knowledge that emerges from and appears in the discourse itself. This discovery of group meaning becomes the springboard for Stahl's outline of a social theory of collaborative knowing. Stahl also discusses such related issues as the distinction between meaning making at the group level and interpretation at the individual level, appropriate research methodology, philosophical directions for group cognition theory, and suggestions for further empirical work.}},

The conceptual bases of computer-supported intentional learning environments (CSILE) come from research on intentional learning, process aspects of expertise, and discourse in knowledge-building communities. These bases combine to support the following propositions: Schools need to be restructured as communities in which the construction of knowledge is supported as a collective goal, and the role of educational technology should be to replace classroom discourse patterns with those having more immediate and natural extensions to knowledge-building communities outside school walls. CSILE is described as a means for refraining classroom discourse to support knowledge building in ways extensible to out-of-school knowledgeadvancing enterprises. Some of the most fundamental problems are logistic, and it is in solving these logistic problems that we see the greatest potential for educational technology.}},

Starting from Papert's introduction of the concept during ICME 2 in 1972, we trace the evolution of theoretical approaches concerning the essence of the idea in an attempt to situate the notion of constructionism in the light of contemporary frameworks. We argue that microworlds, and the search for a learnable mathematics, have a continued relevance to mathematics education, but that the lens research attention has shifted over time, with the current foci on communal design, situated and embodied approaches and artefacts whose use crosses boundaries between different practices. To illustrate these shifts and the challenges that still remain, we present examples from our current work involving the use of microworlds for learning and teaching through communication, design and construction.}},

Such templates initially emerged from a 3-week design-driven classroom teaching experiment on pattern generalization involving linear figural patterns and were assessed for existence in a clinical interview that was conducted four and a half months after the teaching experiment using three tasks (one ambiguous, two well defined). Drawing on the clinical interviews conducted with 11 seventh- and eighth-grade students, I discuss how their visual templates have spawned at least six types of algebraic generalizations. A visual template model is also presented that illustrates the distributed and a dynamically embedded nature of pattern generalization involving the following factors: pattern goodness effect; knowledge/action effects; and the triad of stage-driven grouping, structural unit, and analogy.}},

@article{Kuchemann2010Using,
    abstract = {{A common approach to generalization activities in school algebra is to set them in the context of figurative patterns (e.g., a row of touching squares formed of matchsticks, with a relationship between the numbers of squares and matchsticks; or a row of touching tables surrounded by chairs, with a relationship between the numbers of tables and chairs). This approach allows students to see and explain numerical relationships in terms of the figurative pattern's structure. However, patterns are all too often presented, in textbooks and by teachers and researchers, in the form of a systematic sequence of elements, with the result that students generate a systematic set of ordered pairs for which they try to induce an empirical relationship, divorced from the structure of the pattern that produced them. In this paper, I argue that one reason that students appear to have difficulty in seeing structure is that they are not sufficiently initiated into this way of thinking. Further, I argue that the search for structure can often be done by focusing on an individual element of a pattern and treating it as a prototype, that is, generically. I begin by looking at some of the influences that might have fostered an empirical approach and point to manifestations of this approach in a recent special issue of <i>ZDM  The International Journal on Mathematics Education</i>. I then discuss how well various generalization tasks are suited to a generic approach. Last, I report on a short intervention where students were encouraged to use a generic approach, with positive results.}},

@article{Pratt2010Designing,
    abstract = {{Our focus is on the design of systems (pedagogical, technical, social) that encourage mathematical abstraction, a process we refer to as designing for abstraction. In this paper, we draw on detailed design experiments from our research on children\^{a}s understanding about chance and distribution to re-present this work as a case study in designing for abstraction. Through the case study, we elaborate a number of design heuristics that we claim are also identifiable in the broader literature on designing for mathematical abstraction. Our previous work on the micro-evolution of mathematical knowledge indicated that new mathematical abstractions are routinely forged in activity with available tools and representations, coordinated with relatively na\~{A}¯ve unstructured knowledge. In this paper, we identify the role of design in steering the micro-evolution of knowledge towards the focus of the designer\^{a}s aspirations. A significant finding from the current analysis is the identification of a heuristic in designing for abstraction that requires the intentional blurring of the key mathematical concepts with the tools whose use might foster the construction of that abstraction. It is commonly recognized that meaningful design constructs emerge from careful analysis of children\^{a}s activity in relation to the designer\^{a}s own framework for mathematical abstraction. The case study in this paper emphasizes the insufficiency of such a model for the relationship between epistemology and design. In fact, the case study characterises the dialectic relationship between epistemological analysis and design, in which the theoretical foundations of designing for abstraction and for the micro-evolution of mathematical knowledge can co-emerge.}},

Most microworlds developed so far provide integrated scaffolds to help students\^{a} learning process, but the nature of the interaction makes it difficult to design, develop and evaluate explicit adaptive support according to students\^{a} needs. Building on previous work in the field, this paper proposes a layered approach that simplifies the development and allows both formative and summative evaluation of the different components of the system. As a case study, we present the development of intelligent support for a microworld in the MiGen project, and discuss its evaluation that includes both technical and pedagogical experts of the team.}},

The groups were convened for the purpose of critiquing and refining the concept of pedagogical content knowledge. One practice that became a focus of inquiry in these groups was the tailoring of pedagogical representations to influence students' emotional response to some specific aspect of the subject matter being taught. This practice was named emotional scaffolding. Several examples of emotional scaffolding are provided and a typology of approaches to emotional scaffolding is offered. Possible implications for teacher knowledge theory and teacher education curriculum are explored. 10.1177/0022487103257089}},

Adult learners typically ask questions based on their perceived knowledge needs, whereas with school children, questions are typically asked by the teacher, based on the teacher's perception of the child's needs. Evidence shows that children can produce and recognize educationally productive questions and can adapt them to their knowledge needs. The challenge is to design environments in which students can use such questions to guide their building of knowledge, thus assuming a higher level of agency in learning. Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments (CSILE), a computer-supported knowledge medium designed to support intentional learning, is described, with illustrations of children's use of it in cooperative knowledge building.}},

The effects of these attributes were assessed via pre, post, and retention measures of knowledge of laboratory precautions. Although no statistically significant difference was found, results indicate that co-located information produces a positive effect upon the learning and retention of declarative knowledge. However,  ” interactivity” appears to cause a detrimental effect on learning that depends on user-system activities and performance issues. An interesting finding is that co-located information encourages more extensive exploration of the DVE which, in turn, facilitates retention of spatial knowledge.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract. In this paper, an Adaptive Feedback Framework (AFF) is proposed for the provision of personalized feedback accommodating learners ' individual characteristics and needs in the context of computer-based learning environments. Multiple Informative, Tutoring and Reflective Feedback Components (ITRFC) are incorporated into the framework, aiming to stimulate learners to reflect on their beliefs, to guide and tutor them towards the achievement of specific learning outcomes and to inform them about their performance. The proposed framework adopts a scheme for the categorization of learners ' answer, introduces a multi-layer structure and a stepwise presentation of the ITRFC and supports adaptation of the provided feedback both in the dimensions of adaptivity and adaptability. The adaptivity of the AFF is based on the gradual provision of the ITRFC and on the adaptive presentation of the ITRFC according to learner's knowledge level, preferences and interaction behaviour. The adaptability of the AFF enables learners to have control over the feedback presentation in order to guide the adaptive dimension of the framework. In the context of the web-based concept map assessment tool referred to as COMPASS, the proposed framework has been adopted for the provision of personalized feedback in concept mapping tasks. A preliminary evaluation of the framework in the context of COMPASS showed that the AFF led the majority of the learners in reviewing their maps, reconsidering their beliefs and accomplishing successfully the underlying concept mapping task. 1.}},

@article{BullExtendLM,
    abstract = {{In this paper we maintain that there are benefits to extending the scope of student models to include additional information as part of the explicit student model. We illustrate our argument by describing a student model which focuses on 1. performance in the domain; 2. acquisition order of the target knowledge; 3. analogy; 4. learning strategies; 5. awareness and reflection. The first four of these issues are explicitly represented in the student model. Awareness and reflection should occur as the student model is transparent; it is used to promote learner reflection by encouraging the learner to view, and even negotiate changes to the model. Although the architecture is transferable across domains, each instantiation of the student model will necessarily be domain specific due to the importance of factors such as the relevant background knowledge for analogy, and typical progress through the target material. As an example of this approach we describe the student model of an intelligent computer assisted language learning system which was based on research findings on the above five topics in the field of second language acquisition. Throughout we address the issue of the generality of this model, with particular reference to the possibility of a similar architecture reflecting comparable issues in the domain of learning about electrical circuits.}},

Inspired by the well-known wizard-of-Oz methodology we discuss the need for characterising and carefully controlling the range of its possible variations. We refer to our approach as 'tapering' of the communication capacity of carefully engineered didactical situations and present its application, and a case study from our work with an exploratory environment.

Traditional knowledge representations were developed to encode complete, explicit and executable programs, a goal that makes them less than ideal for representing the incomplete and partial knowledge of a student. In this paper, we discuss state constraints, a type of knowledge unit originally invented to explain how people can detect and correct their own errors. Constraint-based student modeling has been implemented in several intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) so far, and the empirical data verifies that students learn while interacting with these systems. Furthermore, learning curves are smooth when plotted in terms of individual constraints, supporting the psychological appropriateness of the representation. We discuss the differences between constraints and other representational formats, the advantages of constraint-based models and the types of domains in which they are likely to be useful. 1.}},

@article{Conati02,
    abstract = {{When a tutoring system aims to provide students with interactive help, it needs to know what knowledge the student has and what goals the student is currently trying to achieve. That is, it must do both assessment and plan recognition. These modeling tasks involve a high level of uncertainty when students are allowed to follow various lines of reasoning and are not required to show all their reasoning explicitly. We use Bayesian networks as a comprehensive, sound formalism to handle this uncertainty. Using Bayesian networks, we have devised the probabilistic student models for Andes, a tutoring system for Newtonian physics whose philosophy is to maximize student initiative and freedom during the pedagogical interaction. Andes' models provide long-term knowledge assessment, plan recognition, and prediction of students' actions during problem solving, as well as assessment of students' knowledge and understanding as students read and explain worked out examples. In this paper, we describe the basic mechanisms that allow Andes' student models to soundly perform assessment and plan recognition, as well as the Bayesian network solutions to issues that arose in scaling up the model to a full-scale, field evaluated application. We also summarize the results of several evaluations of Andes which provide evidence on the accuracy of its student models.}},

Introduction In a review of the 1987 "Artificial Intelligence and Education" Conference, Sandberg (1987) summarised a general opinion that "detailed user models do not necessarily enhance the capability of an intelligent tutoring system ... good teaching can do without a detailed user model, because in good teaching serious misconceptions are avoided, and errors will be repaired on the spot ... it is debatable whether the cost of constructing very  3  detailed, complex user models that are runnable and have to be maintained all the time is worth...}},

A synopsis structure IST (Inverse Closed Sequence Tree) is designed to keep inverse closed sequential patterns in current window. An efficient algorithm SeqStream is developed to mine closed sequential patterns in stream windows incrementally, and various novel strategies are adopted in SeqStream to prune search space aggressively.

    abstract = {{Abstract  Frequent pattern mining has been a focused theme in data mining research for over a decade. Abundant literature has been dedicated to this research and tremendous progress has been made, ranging from efficient and scalable algorithms for frequent itemset mining in transaction databases to numerous research frontiers, such as sequential pattern mining, structured pattern mining, correlation mining, associative classification, and frequent pattern-based clustering, as well as their broad applications. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the current status of frequent pattern mining and discuss a few promising research directions. We believe that frequent pattern mining research has substantially broadened the scope of data analysis and will have deep impact on data mining methodologies and applications in the long run. However, there are still some challenging research issues that need to be solved before frequent pattern mining can claim a cornerstone approach in data mining applications.}},

We introduce the problem of mining sequential patterns over such databases. We present three algorithms to solve this problem, and empirically evaluate their performance using synthetic data. Two of the proposed algorithms, AprioriSome and AprioriAll, have comparable performance, albeit AprioriSome performs a little better when the minimum number of customers that must support a sequential pattern is low. Scale-up experiments show that both AprioriSome and AprioriAll scale linearly with the number of customer transactions. They also have excellent scale-up properties with respect to the number of transactions per customer and the number of items in a transaction.}},

An alternative source ofevidence, especially valuable for understanding the purposes for which the application was built, can be the dynamic behavior of the system, and more specifically the system-user interaction. We have developed a method for modeling the application behavior from the user's perspective in the form of use case models, using recorded traces of system-user interaction. We use data mining and pattern matching methods to mine these traces for frequently occurring user tasks. When interesting patterns are discovered, they are augmented with semantic information and they are used to build use case models. We demonstrate a successful application of this method to recover use case models from interaction traces with legacy 3270 systems to serve user interface reengineering activities.}},

    abstract = {{In this paper, a neural network implementation for a fuzzy logic-based model of the diagnostic process is proposed as a means to achieve accurate student diagnosis and updates of the student model in Intelligent Learning Environments. The neurofuzzy synergy allows the diagnostic model to some extent "imitate" teachers in diagnosing students' characteristics, and equips the intelligent learning environment with reasoning capabilities that can be further used to drive pedagogical decisions depending on the student learning style. The neuro-fuzzy implementation helps to encode both structured and non-structured teachers' knowledge: when teachers' reasoning is available and well defined, it can be encoded in the form of fuzzy rules; when teachers' reasoning is not well defined but is available through practical examples illustrating their experience, then the networks can be trained to represent this experience. The proposed approach has been tested in diagnosing aspects of student's learning style in a discovery-learning environment that aims to help students to construct the concepts of vectors in physics and mathematics. The diagnosis outcomes of the model have been compared against the recommendations of a group of five experienced teachers, and the results produced by two alternative soft computing methods. The results of our pilot study show that the neuro-fuzzy model successfully manages the inherent uncertainty of the diagnostic process; especially for marginal cases, i.e. where it is very difficult, even for human tutors, to diagnose and accurately evaluate students by directly synthesizing subjective and, some times, conflicting judgments.}},

    abstract = {{What makes Dynamic Geometry Environment (DGE) a powerful mathematical knowledge acquisition microworld is its ability to visually make explicit the implicit dynamism of thinking about mathematical geometrical concepts. One of DGE\^{a}s powers is to equip us with the ability to retain the background of a geometrical configuration while we can selectively bring to the fore dynamically those parts of the whole configuration that interest us. That is, we can visually study the variation of an aspect of a DGE figure while keeping other aspects constant, hence anticipating the emergence of invariant patterns. The aim of this paper is to expound the epistemic value of variation of the Dragging tool in DGE in mathematical discovery. Functions of variation (contrast, separation, generalization, fusion) proposed in Marton\^{a}s theory of learning and awareness will be used as a framework to develop a discernment structure which can act as a lens to organize and interpret dragging explorations in DGE. Such a lens focuses very strongly on mathematical aspects of dragging in DGE and is used to re-interpret known dragging modalities (e.g., Arzarello et al.) in a potentially more mathematically-relevant way. The exposition will centre about a specific geometrical problem in which two dragging trajectories are mapped out, consequently resulting in a DGE theorem and a visual theorem. In doing so, a new spectral dragging strategy will be introduced that literally allows one to see the drag mode in action. A model for the lens of variation in the form of a discernment nest structure is proposed as a meta-tool to interpret dragging experiences or as a meta-language to relate different dragging analyses which consequently might give rise to pedagogical and epistemological implications.}},

@book{ContextualDesign,
    abstract = {{There's certainly no shortage of software design methods: most demand total allegiance, and many claim to be the only true way to delivering useful and maintainable software systems in a timely manner. <I>Contextual Design</I> describes another worthwhile software engineering method, one that places the user (or customer) at the forefront of the software design process from beginning to end. This method seems to be a particularly worthwhile addition to the literature.<p> Contextual Design begins with <I>contextual inquiry</I>, where software developers interview users and attempt to understand the way they work. Such "customer empathy" is central to the Contextual Design process and a total understanding of "work" within organizations is the mantra here. The book describes how, later in the process, software developers step back from the user data and do an "affinity," which is an overall analysis of hundreds (or even thousands) of individual facts. <I>Contextual Design</I> then explains the additional steps required to build systems using this method, including building models for flow, sequence, and artifacts, and establishing the cultural and the physical environments for a system. After getting an overview, developers consolidate these initial models, get more user input, and then design user interfaces.<p> This book, written in a clear, informal style without excessive jargon, reads very much like a book on business motivation. Various practitioners of Contextual Design offer short testimonials on the software design method.} {<p>This book introduces a customer-centered approach to business by showing how data gathered from people while they work can drive the definition of a product or process while supporting the needs of teams and their organizations. This is a practical, hands-on guide for anyone trying to design systems that reflect the way customers want to do their work. The authors developed Contextual Design, the method discussed here, through their work with teams struggling to design products and internal systems. In this book, you'll find the underlying principles of the method and how to apply them to different problems, constraints, and organizational situations.<br><br><p>Contextual Design enables you to<br>* gather detailed data about how people work and use systems <br>* develop a coherent picture of a whole customer population <br>* generate systems designs from a knowledge of customer work<br>* diagram a set of existing systems, showing their relationships, inconsistencies, redundancies, and omissions}},

We formalized our assumptions about what could be implemented, then used the Wizard of Oz to flesh out a design and observe users' reactions as they taught several editing tasks. We found: a) all users invent a similar set of commands to teach the agent; b) users learn the agent's language by copying its speech; c) users teach simple tasks with ease and complex ones with reasonable effort; and d) agents cannot expect users to point to or identify critical features without prompting.   In conducting this rather complex simulation, we learned some lessons about using the Wizard of Oz to prototype intelligent agents: a) design of the simulation benefits greatly from prior implementation experience; b) the agent's behavior and dialog capabilities must be based on formal models; c) studies of verbal discourse lead directly to an implementable system; d) the designer benefits greatly by becoming the Wizard; and e) qualitative data is more valuable for answering global concerns, while quantitative data validates accounts and answers fine-grained questions.}},

This approach is contrasted to other principled design approaches, for example, get it right the first time, reliance on design guidelines. Empirically, the article presents data which show that our design principles are not always intuitive to designers; identifies the arguments which designers often offer for not using these principles—and answers them; and provides an example in which our principles have been used successfully.}},

However, during natural interactions there are no constraints on the human tutor's behavior and thus tutorial strategies are difficult to analyze and reproduce in a computational model. To overcome this problem, we have realized a Wizard of Oz interface, which by constraining the tutor's interaction makes explicit his decisions about why, how, and when to assist the student in a computer-based learning environment. These decisions automatically generate natural language utterances of different types according to two  ” politeness” strategies. We have successfully used the interface to model tutorial strategies.}},

    abstract = {{Meanings of "surprise" are wide and include uplifting and engaging facets like wonder and amazement on the one hand as well as ones that may be of the opposite nature like interruption and disrupt on the other. Pedagogically, educators who use surprise in class activities are focusing on students being "taken aback" by a situation, hopefully causing them to "look again" and spurring them to further effort to resolve an anomaly. In this sense, surprise implies facing something unexpected, out of place, counterintuitive, or somewhat "not fitting". It implies that the learner has met the elements of the situation separately before, but is now associating them for the first time, as in much of learning. It also implies that there is some emotional charge, in the sense that the person is intrigued enough to make the further effort. In this article, the author reflects on the role of surprise in mathematics classrooms. He discusses the personal and social aspects of surprise, the requirements for increasing chances of surprise, the different types of surprise, and the role of motivation.}},

We represent a designed artifact as the set of user scenarios supported by that artifact and more finely by causal schemas detailing the underlying psychological rationale. These schemas, called claims, unpack wherefores and whys of the scenarios. In this paper, we stand back from several empirical projects to clarify our commitments and practices.}},

@inproceedings{JohnsonIterativeEvaluation05,

Although the distinction is valid, it is inadequate for many AIED systems because they require multiple types of evaluation and multiple stages of evaluation. Developers of interactive intelligent learning environments must evaluate the effectiveness of the component technologies, the quality of the user interaction, and the potential of the program to achieve learning outcomes, in order to uncover problems prior to summative evaluation. Often these intermediate evaluations go unreported, so other developers cannot benefit from the lessons learned. This paper documents the iterative evaluation of the Tactical Language Training System, an interactive game for learning foreign language and culture. This project employs a highly iterative development and evaluation cycle. The courseware and software have already undergone six discrete stages of formative evaluation, and further formative evaluations are planned. The paper documents the evaluations that were taken at each stage, as well as the information obtained, and draws lessons that may be applicable to other AIED systems.}},

How do instructional treatments that emphasizes self-explanation affect students' learning, as compared to other instructional treatments? We investigated whether self-explanation can be scaffolded effectively in a classroom environment using a Cognitive Tutor, which is intelligent instructional software that supports guided learning by doing. In two classroom experiments, we found that students who explained their steps during problem-solving practice with a Cognitive Tutor learned with greater understanding compared to students who did not explain steps. The explainers better explained their solutions steps and were more successful on transfer problems. We interpret these results as follows: By engaging in explanation, students acquired better-integrated visual and verbal declarative knowledge and acquired less shallow procedural knowledge. The research demonstrates that the benefits of self-explanation can be achieved in a relatively simple computer-based approach that scales well for classroom use.}},

The computer approach is formulated within a wider framework ofversatile thinking in which global, holistic processing complements local, sequential processing. This is done through a combination of programming in BASIC, physical activities which simulate computer storage and manipulation of variables, and specific software which evaluates expressions in standard mathematical notation. The software is designed to enable the user to explore examples and non-examples of a concept, in this case equivalent and non-equivalent expressions. We call such a piece of software ageneric organizer because if offers examples and non-examples which may be seen not just in specific terms, but as typical, or generic, examples of the algebraic processes, assisting the pupil in the difficult task of abstracting the more general concept which they represent. Empirical evidence from several related studies shows that such an approach significantly improves the understanding of higher order concepts in algebra, and that any initial loss in manipulative facility through lack of practice is more than made up at a later stage.}},

We find that within the classrooms studied, no other type of off-task behavior is associated nearly so strongly with reduced learning as "gaming the system": behavior aimed at obtaining correct answers and advancing within the tutoring curriculum by systematically taking advantage of regularities in the software's feedback and help. A student's frequency of gaming the system correlates as strongly to post-test score as the student's prior domain knowledge and general academic achievement. Controlling for prior domain knowledge, students who frequently game the system score substantially lower on a post-test than students who never game the system. Analysis of students who choose to game the system suggests that learned helplessness or performance orientation might be better accounts for why students choose this behavior than lack of interest in the material. This analysis will inform the future re-design of tutors to respond appropriately when students game the system.}},

    abstract = {{In this paper we explore human tutors' inferences in relation to learners' affective states and the relationship between those inferences and the actions that tutors take as their consequence. At the core of the investigations presented in this paper lie fundamental questions associated with the role of affective considerations in computer-mediated educational interactions. Theory of linguistic politeness is used as the basis for determining the contextual factors relevant to human tutors's actions, with special attention being dedicated to learner affective states. A study was designed to determine what affective states of the learners are relevant to tutoring mathematics and to identify the mechanisms used by tutors to predict such states. Logs of tutor-student dialogues were recorded along with contextual factors taken into consideration by tutors in relation to their specific tutorial dialogue moves. The logs were annotated in order to determine the types and range of student and tutor actions. Machine learning techniques were then applied to those actions to predict the values of three factors: student confidence, interest and effort. Whilst due to limited size and sparsity of data the results are not conclusive, they are very valuable as the basis for empirically derived hypotheses to be tested in further studies. The potential implications of the hypotheses, if they were confirmed by further studies, are discussed in relation to the impact of tutor's ability to diagnose student affect on the nature of computer-mediated tutorial interactions.}},

@article{Chalmers2003Role,
    abstract = {{Many computer users have trouble learning and remembering information presented on a computer screen. Based on cognitive theories, part of the reason for lack of retention is hypothesized to be the user's inability to form a mental picture, or schema, of the information presented via a computer screen. In order to form a schema, users need to be able to understand where newly acquired knowledge fits into  ” the big picture”. However, computers and the information on them are so infinite, users may have trouble thinking in terms of a big picture. When on a website, for example, how many times have you asked yourself,  ” Where am I?” or  ” Where was I?” or  ” Where am I going?” Likewise, for many learners, there may be little sense of place when learning with the assistance of a computer. It is proposed that these problems of the inability to form a schema and disorientation with the human–computer interface are worth researching, not only for better retention, but also for increased satisfaction among users. In addition to cognitive theories of learning, retention, organization, and individual differences, human–computer interface guidelines are also addressed. For this paper, the phrase human–computer interface is also called the  ” user interface” because of the emphasis on the end user, or the student. It may also be called simply the interface. Human–computer interface is defined as the point of contact between the computer and the computer user.}},

@electronic{Cumming1991Learner,
    abstract = {{Our purpose is to argue that conceptions of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) need to change in response to enriched ideas of the learning that can be supported by a computer. We refer to 'intelligent educational systems ' (IESs), which will offer comments and advice to the user considered as collaborator in learning, rather than direction to the user considered as pupil. Learner modelling in the collaborative IES can be a shared activity, with the learner model even being open to inspection and change by the learner. The conversational interaction of system and learner is likely to have a number of strands, with a jump to an alternative strand being used when an impasse occurs. Building such IESs will need the study of collaborative and conversational aspects of human tutoring interactions. First, consider user models in general. Any device intended for human use embodies a model of its user. For example, the size and shape of a screwdriver handle betray assumptions about characteristics of likely users. The model may be of classes of user, as with normal screwdrivers, or of a single user, as when I insist on a screwdriver shaped to my own hand. The model may be constant over time or, in the case of devices capable of modifying themselves, may be dynamic: it may always be changing to fit better the current state of the user.}},

This model is based on the insights that general conflict resolution expertise exists separately from domain-level design expertise, and that this expertise can be instantiated in the context of particular conflicts into specific advice for resolving these conflicts. Conflict resolution expertise consists of a taxonomy of design conflict classes and associated general advice suitable for resolving conflicts in these classes. The abstract nature of conflict resolution expertise makes it applicable to a wide variety of design domains. The author describes this conflict resolution model and provides examples of its operation from an implemented cooperative design system for local area network design that uses machine-based design agents. How this model is being extended to support and learn from collaboration of human design agents is discussed}},

the work presented in this paper is based on the assumption

provide not only communication but rather computer-mediated collaboration.

The first section contains a short discussion of some epistemological aspects of generalization. Drawing on this section, a definition of algebraic generalization of patterns is suggested. This definition is used in the subsequent sections to distinguish between algebraic and arithmetic generalizations and some elementary na\"{i}ve forms of induction to which students often resort to solve pattern problems. The rest of the paper discusses the implementation of a teaching sequence in a Grade 7 class and focuses on the social, sign-mediated processes of objectification through which the students reached stable forms of algebraic reflection. The semiotic analysis puts into evidence two central processes of objectification—iconicity and contraction.}},

Ontological Innovation and the Role of Theory in Design Experiments

The motivation for this article is our belief that theory is critically important but currently underplayed in design research studies. We seek to characterize and illustrate a genre of theorizing that seems to us strongly synergistic with design-based research. We begin by drawing contrasts with kinds of theory that are relevant but, we contend, by themselves inadequate. A central element of the type of productive design-based theorizing on which we focus is "ontological innovation," hypothesizing and developing explanatory constructs, new categories of things in the world that help explain how it works. A key criterion to which we adhere when discussing ontological innovations is that theory must do real design work in generating, selecting and validating design alternatives at the level at which they are consequential for learning. Developing and refining an ontological innovation is challenging and requires the kind of extensive, iterative work that characterizes design experiments more generally. However, the pay-off in terms of clarity of focus and explanatory power can be great. We present two case studies that illustrate the development, refinement, extension, and instructional application of ontological innovations.}},

In the former category, algebraic arguments were popular. In the latter, students preferred arguments that they could evaluate and that they found convincing and explanatory, preferences that excluded algebra. Empirical argument predominated in students' own proof constructions, although most students were aware of its limitations. The most successful students presented proofs in everyday language, not using algebra. Students' responses were influenced mainly by their mathematical competence but also by curricular factors, their views of proof, and their genders.}},

Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given.

Specifically, techniques from information visualization (IV) are employed to graphically render complex, multidimensional student tracking data. Several graphical representations are generated to help distance learning instructors get a better understanding of social, behavioural, and cognitive aspects related to learners. The evaluation of CourseVis shows that it can help instructors to quickly identify tendencies in their classes and discover individuals that might need special attention. This suggests that the effectiveness of CMSs can be improved by integrating IV techniques to generate appropriate graphical representations, similar to those produced in CourseVis.}},

Our approach is based on the design and development of a computational microworld, which afforded students the means to construct a range of representational models (symbolic, visual and numeric) of infinity-related objects (infinite sequences, in particular). We present episodes based on four students' activities, seeking to illustrate how the available tools mediated students' understandings of the infinite in rich ways, allowing them to discriminate subtle process-oriented features of infinite processes. We claim that the microworld supported students in the coordination of hitherto unconnected or conflicting intuitions concerning infinity, based on a constructive articulation of different representational forms we name as 'representational moderation'.}},

The overall purpose of this paper is to consider the conceptual aspects of learning a transformational skill (use of the distributive law to produce equivalent algebraic expressions) in a learning sequence composed of both spreadsheets and paper-and-pencil activities. We conducted a sequence of classroom activities in several classes, and analyzed the students' work on a spreadsheet activity and on an assessment activity by both qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings indicate both encouraging benefits and some potential sources of difficulties caused by the use of spreadsheets at initial stages of learning symbolic transformations.}},

The research draws from Vygotsky's historical-cultural school of psychology, on the one hand, and from Bakhtin and Voloshinov's theory of discourse on the other, and is grounded in a semiotic-cultural theoretical framework in which algebraic thinking is considered as a sign-mediated cognitive praxis. Within this theoretical framework, the students' algebraic activity is investigated in the interaction of the individual's subjectivity and the social means of semiotic objectification. An ethnographic qualitative methodology, supported by historic, epistemological research, ensured the design and interpretation of a set of teaching activities. The paper focuses on the discussion held by a small group of students of which an interpretative, situated discourse analysis is provided. The results shed some light on the students' production of (oral and written) signs and their meanings as they engage in the construction of expressions of mathematical generality and on the social nature of their emergent algebraic thinking.}},

Although our outlook is theoretical, our thinking about abstraction emerges from the analysis of interview data. We consider abstraction an activity of vertically reorganizing previously constructed mathematics into a new mathematical structure. We use the term activity to emphasize that abstraction is a process with a history; it may capitalize on tools and other artifacts, and it occurs in a particular social setting. We present the core of a model for the genesis of abstraction. The principal components of the model are three dynamically nested epistemic actions: constructing, recognizing, and building-with. To study abstraction is to identify these epistemic actions of students participating in an activity of abstraction.}},

The computer approach is formulated within a wider framework ofversatile thinking in which global, holistic processing complements local, sequential processing. This is done through a combination of programming in BASIC, physical activities which simulate computer storage and manipulation of variables, and specific software which evaluates expressions in standard mathematical notation. The software is designed to enable the user to explore examples and non-examples of a concept, in this case equivalent and non-equivalent expressions. We call such a piece of software ageneric organizer because if offers examples and non-examples which may be seen not just in specific terms, but as typical, or generic, examples of the algebraic processes, assisting the pupil in the difficult task of abstracting the more general concept which they represent. Empirical evidence from several related studies shows that such an approach significantly improves the understanding of higher order concepts in algebra, and that any initial loss in manipulative facility through lack of practice is more than made up at a later stage.}},

These concepts are illustrated by reference to the author's research on children's understanding of angle concepts. The question of how mathematics teaching would be affected if more explicit attention were given to abstraction and generalisation in the classroom is then considered.
