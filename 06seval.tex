\label{sec:summative-evaluation}

Phase~D of the project (June 2011 February 2012, see
Section~\ref{sec:methodology}) included summative evaluation of the TA
tools. This evaluation comprised two parts. The first part was a
classroom-based trial involving one of our teacher collaborators at
her school. This teacher had worked closely with us in Phase A and
indeed was one of the teachers who had participated in a classroom
trial in Phase B. A one-to-one session was first held with this
teacher where she was introduced to the final versions of the TA
tools, and where she planned two one-hour lessons that she would
undertake with a class of 28 14-year-olds using the MiGen system.

During the first lesson, the TA tools were installed on a tablet PC
which she carried around the class with her and consulted as she
wished as her students were undertaking the task set in
eXpresser. During the second lesson, which took place the next day,
the teacher did not have access to the TA tools and had to support the
students as they were working with eXpresser without having access to
the information that the TA tools provide.

During and at the end of both lessons a member of the research team
shadowed the teacher and asked her a number of questions covering
between them all the usage scenarios US1--US8, with the aim of finding
out the extent to which the TA~tools met the requirements of the usage
scenarios. These questions are listed in
Figure~\ref{fig:summquest}. One of the main
objectives was to interrupt the interaction between teacher and
students as little as possible; the goal is twofold: first, as
observers, we wanted to reduce the cognitive overload of the teacher
as much as possible, helping her to provide answers quickly and
precisely; second, pragmatically, we wanted to reduce the interruption
of her teacher duties to a minimum. The questions were designed to be
answerable in less than sixty seconds. They were asked at (apparently
for the teacher) random moments during the lessons, and they were not
asked if the teacher was helping a student but only when the teacher
was "moving between students".

The teacher was interrupted only three times, each time for no more
than 60 seconds, being asked the questions shown at
Figure~\ref{fig:summquest} (the
times shown are approximate), with additional questions and debriefing
at the end of the lesson. On the first day ---with the TA tools--- the
teacher was able to answer quickly and effectively Question~1 and
Question~2. For example, when asked "which students have achieved Task
Goal~3?" she correctly changed to the "Goal Achievement" tool and
pointed on the students that had that goal as "achieved" (in
green). At the end of the session, the teacher could answer correctly
question~4i. 
%
While debriefing the session, the teacher said that
answering questions 3 and 4ii required having a global view of the
class "learning" status that was difficult to get from the tools (let
alone without them).\ednote{This points to future work on HLI.}
%
Regarding question~5, she commented on her plans for the next session
using the information on the tools to ground her arguments (e.g.~``I
see that there are several students that did not complete the last
goal (general rule), so I will make a stronger point about it next day
to make it clearer'').

On the second day ---without the tools--- the teacher was able to
answer the questions only in vague terms (e.g.~``I think one of
those students over there has finished''). In the after-class debrief,
she commented that having the tools made a real difference and without
them it was unfeasible to get a "view" of the class, possibly because
paying attention to twenty students required very frequent changes of
context and "the forest gets lost behind the trees".

  Question 1 (15 minutes into the lesson): (i) which students are
  progressing satisfactorily in undertaking the task? [relates to
  Usage Scenario US2], (ii) which students may be in difficulty?
  [US2], and (iii) which students need your immediate help? [US1]

  Question 2 (at 25min): which students may be disengaged from the task?
  [US3] which students have achieved Task Goal 3? [US6]

  Question 3 (at 35min): what common conceptual or procedural
  difficulties are students facing? [US4], what explanation might you
  give to the whole class at this time? [US4]

  Question 4 (end of lesson): Now that the lesson has finished,
  (i) which students have finished the task? [US5], (ii) what
  additional guidance might you give to any particular students?
  [US7].

  Question 5 (after end of lesson): What are your views about the
  classs achievements in this lesson, plus how might you plan the next
  lesson? [US8]

The second part of the summative evaluation involved a 2-hour session
held with a new cohort of 11 trainee maths teachers on the
Postgraduate Certificate in Education programme at the IoE. Each of
the participants had an installation of the MiGen system running on
their computer. In the first half of the session, participants were
introduced to the MiGen project, the MiGen system as a whole, the
eXpresser, and the TA tools. In particular, the TA tools were
introduced to participants loaded with the real student interaction
data as arising from the classroom trial undertaken in the first part
of the summative evaluation and described above. Participants were
then asked to use the TA tools and the time-stop functionality to
answer a short list of questions relating to usage scenarios US1-US6
at different time points in the lesson. The questions are listed in
Appendix 2 (each relating to a usage scenario). 
Participants were also asked how long it would take them to
answer these questions in the classroom – our aim being not only to
determine if participants were able to use the TA tools to answer the
questions correctly, but how they perceived the amount of time it
would take them to answer the questions in a classroom situation. 

\begin{table}[tb]
  \centering
  \begin{framed}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Q1. The session started~10’~ago (“10~minutes on”). If you chose a
    student to help immediately, which student(s) would you choose and
    why?
  \item Q2. Based on your experience and previous sessions you would have
    expected by now (“10~minutes on”) that students have achieved at
    least two goals. With a quick glance of the tools would you say
    that the class overall is going according to plan or would you
    intervene and why?
  \item Q3. We are at “30~minutes on”. Based on your experience and
    previous sessions you expected that students would have finished
    by now so that you can progress on the next task. With a quick
    glance of the tools do you think that the class is at that stage
    and why?
  \item Q4. Sometimes students are off-task (e.g. play
    games). At~“30~minutes on”, find two students that are
    disengaged/distracted?
  \item Q5. We are at~“30~minutes on”. Some students need help and you are
    trying to identify others who have finished and can help them. Can
    you give two examples of students who have finished? 
  \end{itemize}

  \caption{Questions asked to trainee Math teachers for the summative
    evaluation of the Teacher Assistance tools. Teachers had to answer
    the question and record the time they needed to do so (ranging
    from ``1 -- Very little'' to ``5 -- A lot of time'')} 
  \label{fig:questions-pgce}
\end{table}

All students provided correct examples without any assistance from the
team. The graph shown in Figure~\ref{fig:perceived-time} analyses the
responses relating to the perceived length of time required to
 answer each question. We see, that for all
the questions, no participant responded that they needed a long time
or a lot of time to answer. The questions that were regarded as
requiring the least time to answer were questions 1, 4 and 5, most
likely because they pertain to individual students and could be
answered by consulting just a single tool (the CD tool). Questions 2
and 3 may have appeared to participants as taking more time to answer
because they refer to the classroom as a whole and because, in order
to have a better picture, participants may have consulted the GA tool
as well, and even the ST tool in Question 2 for a more detailed view
of how students are progressing with their constructions. On the
whole, we consider the responses satisfactory particularly as no
answers were perceived as requiring long or a lot of time, which was
our aim.

Finally, participants were asked to respond to the following list of
questions, relating to their perceived usefulness of the TA tools for
usage scenarios US1-US8 (where Q1 relates to US1, Q2 to US3, Q3 to
US6, Q4 to US2 and US7(i), Q5 to US7(ii), Q6 to US8, Q7 to US4.) Their
response to each question was selected from 5 choices: Totally Agree,
Agree, Not sure, Disagree, Totally Disagree.

  \item either in the classroom or after the class, to identify common
    conceptual and procedural difficulties students are facing in

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:perceived-time} presents the responses relating to each
question. We 
see that there are no responses of Totally Disagree to any question,
and that only Q7 attracted 2 answers of Disagree. Q1, Q2, Q3, Q5, Q6
had mostly responses of Agree or Totally Agree. Q4 had 4 responses of
Not Sure, and it related to using the tools to inform the provision of
support and guidance to students during the lesson. Q7 had the worst
pattern of responses, with 2 answers of Disagree and 4 answers of Not
Sure, and it related to identifying common conceptual or procedural
difficulties that students are facing. We discuss these results in
more detail in the next Section.
